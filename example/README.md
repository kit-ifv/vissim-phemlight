# Vissim PHEMlight example

There are three links in this Vissim model.

All three links have the same traffic volume and the same driving behavior.
On each link, the passenger cars are influenced by a traffic signal.

For each vehicle, different emissions are calculated using PHEMlight during the simulation.
On the left link, the vehicle input contains passenger cars with emission class Euro 4, powered by **gasoline**.
On the right side passenger cars with **diesel** Euro 4.
On the middle link, both vehicle types have equal shares.

The colors of the link segments show the calculated NOx emissions.
The bars show the fuel consumption.
